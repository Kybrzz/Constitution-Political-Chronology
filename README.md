# Political_Chronology

-------------------------------------------------------------------
A chronological record of my political and philosophical writings. 
Debate, citation, and critique are encouraged.
This project has two overarching cateogries of work:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

## I. Responses to Political Questions

---------------------------------------------------------------------
An archive of my responses to political questions. 
Entries are retained permanently. 
Revisions, when implemented, are logged explicitly with dates. 

Each entry includes:
- Date of creation and online entry 
- Exists as an original handwritten PDF with a corresponding transcription
- Suggested citation
- A discussion thread for public debate and critique
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### II. Personal Constitution 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
A personal journal outlining my values, structured as dated entries. 
Entries are logged chronologically. 
Eventually, theme categorization will be implemented so ideas can be 
reorganized into a coherent theme structure.
This is intended to evolve into a unified philosophical work.

Each entry includes:
- Date of creation and online entry
- Exists as an original handwritten PDF with a corresponding transcription
- Suggested citation
- A discussion thread for public debate and critique
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### III. Additional Information
