**Constitution + Political Query Chronology**

A public, version-controlled archive of my philosophical and political writings.
This project is explicitly bifurcated into a Personal Constitution and a Political Query Chronology, with the former governing the latter.
Academic debate, citation, and critique are welcomed.
Revisions, when implemented, are preserved alongside prior versions and dated
to maintain traceability and accountability. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

# I. Personal Constitution 

Framework detailing my positions on varied topics. 
Unwavering in commitment and instantiation yet corrigible given sufficient adversarial critique.
This is intended to evolve into a unified philosophical work.

Each entry includes:
- Date of creation and online entry
- The original handwritten PDF with a corresponding transcription
- Suggested citation format
- A public discussion thread for conflictual refinement

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## II. Political Query Chronology

An archive of my responses to political questions, written given the constraints listed
by the Personal Constitution. 
Entries are retained in perpetuity. 

Each entry includes:
- Date of creation and online entry 
- The original handwritten PDF with a corresponding transcription
- Suggested citation format
- A public discussion thread for conflictual refinement
